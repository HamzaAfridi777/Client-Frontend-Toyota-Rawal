          <div className="autoRepairDetail-cont">
             <h6>WHEN YOU SHOULD GET AN OIL CHANGE</h6>

             <p>
                The inner workings of an engine create a substantial amount of heat due to the friction of moving components. Oil keeps the engine’s components lubricated and working efficiently and alleviate some of the heat. After driving many miles or after a period of time the engine oil begins to break down and becomes less efficient requiring a change.
             </p>

             <p>
                The interval of oil changes can vary from vehicle to vehicle as determined by the manufacturer’s recommendations of quantity and oil weight used. Sun Auto Service follows all intervals as advocated by the vehicle’s manufacturer in severe climate conditions. In most cases, a Synthetic Blend oil change for this climate is every 3,000 miles while Full Synthetic oil change service should be performed between 5,000 – 6,000 miles.
             </p>

             <h6>SYMPTOMS THAT INDICATE YOU NEED AN OIL CHANGE</h6>

             <p>
                Most modern vehicles have an oil change indicator that alerts the driver when the oil needs to be changed. These systems generally rely on mileage and not on sensors that identify oil quality. Most cars are not equipped with a system that indicates when the vehicle is long past due for its oil change.
             </p>

             <p>
                Symptoms that indicate the engine has exceeded the recommended oil change interval includes:
             </p>

             <ul>
                <li>Significant mileage from last oil change</li>
                <li>Check engine or service require light illuminated</li>
                <li>Discolored, dirty oil</li>
                <li>Engine knocking</li>
             </ul>

             <h6>SUN AUTO SERVICE OIL CHANGE PROCESS</h6>

             <p>
                At Sun Auto Service, we’re proud to offer a smooth and comprehensive oil change experience. The service begins by the Technician moving the vehicle into a designated service area where the car is lifted to initiate the inspection and service. Each Technician utilizes a 2-page report containing a checklist of systems and components to check for any areas of concern where maintenance or repairs may be needed presently and what may be required in the future.
             </p>

             <p>
                The Technician drains the old fluid from the vehicle and removes the oil filter. The Technician then inserts a new oil filter and will complete a chassis lube if applicable. Once complete, the Technician will check and top off all accessible fluids including windshield washer fluid. Finally, the tires will be rotated.
             </p>

             <p>
                Sun Auto Service pledges to use only superior quality Engine Oils and Fluids from Valvoline. Our service centers are stocked with a full line of Valvoline Fluids including Full Synthetic and Synthetic Blend Oils, and manufacturer specific drivetrain and Transmission fluids. All filter and fluids meet or exceed requirements of vehicle manufacturers.
             </p>

             <p>
                At Sun Auto Service, we service all makes and models of cars and light trucks. Because we service a wide-variety of vehicles, we supply many oils to accommodate each individual vehicle, such as:
             </p>

                <li>High Mileage Oil</li>
