                          <p><strong>Q: What will help protect me in a vehicle accident? </strong></p>
                          <p>Seat belts are the primary safety feature in your vehicle to protect occupants during an accident. The seatbelts help to restrain the occupant in case of a collision and serve as the primary restraint system. The Owner&rsquo;s Manual hence stipulates that all occupants should wear their seatbelts and the Company frequently highlights the importance of such safety features to the public.</p>
                          <p>In certain types of severe frontal collisions and impact, SRS Airbags also works, together with seat belts to help reduce the risk of serious injury.</p>
                          <p><strong>Q: Which types of Airbags are installed in the Toyota vehicles manufactured in Pakistan? </strong></p>
                          <p>Currently all Toyota vehicles manufactured and sold by Indus Motor Company Limited in Pakistan are equipped with Dual Front Supplement Restraint System (&ldquo;SRS&rdquo;) Airbags. In addition to that REVO V, REVO G &amp; Fortuner models are equipped with Driver Knee Airbags as well.</p>
                          <p><strong>Q: Do airbags deploy when the driver or the passenger side individual is not wearing seatbelts? </strong></p>
                          <p>Yes, Front SRS Airbags (Driver + Passenger) will deploy when the vehicle is subjected to certain types of severe frontal collisions and impacts regardless of whether the driver or passenger have fastened their seat belt or not.</p>
                          <p>For all deployment conditions please refer to your Owner&rsquo;s manual.</p>
                          <p><strong>Q: How many airbag sensors are installed in the vehicle? </strong></p>
                          <p>There are 3 airbag sensors in a vehicle. Please refer to the owner&rsquo;s manual provided with vehicles to review the specified components within the SRS Airbag system.</p>
                          <p><strong>Q: Is there any option to switch off the Airbag? In which product / model this option is available? Why is it so and How does it work? </strong></p>
                          <p>Yes, there is Manual ON &amp; OFF switch given in Revo V/ G &amp; Fortuner vehicles only for passenger side Front SRS airbag only. This system deactivates the front passenger SRS Airbag. The owner should however only deactivate the SRS Airbag when using a child restraint system such as a Child Seat on the front passenger seat.</p>
                          <p>Note: Please refer to the owner&rsquo;s manual provided with vehicles to review the specified circumstances and conditions required for using this option.</p>
                          <p><strong>Q: Is there any mechanism at dealerships for service of airbags? </strong></p>
                          <p>There is no need to continually service SRS Airbags. If the vehicle diagnostic system detects any problem, the SRS light will appear after vehicle is started, as detailed in the Owner&rsquo;s Manual. At that point please stop driving and immediately visit your nearest Toyota Authorized Dealership for assistance.</p>
